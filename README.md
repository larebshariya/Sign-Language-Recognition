# Sign-Language-Recognition
This project focuses on the development of a real-time sign language recognition system using deep learning, computer vision techniques, and object detection. Aimed at improving communication for individuals with hearing or speech impairments, the system employs cameras and advanced algorithms to interpret sign language gestures and translate them into spoken or written language. Furthermore, it includes a text-to-voice feature, enabling seamless communication for users who may not be proficient in sign language. By incorporating object detection, the system can accurately identify hand movements and gestures, enhancing the recognition process. Bridging the gap between sign language and spoken language, this system aims to enhance inclusivity and accessibility in society, fostering empathy and understanding among individuals with diverse communication needs. Through empowerment and the promotion of equal opportunities, this project strives to contribute to a more inclusive and compassionate world where everyone can communicate freely and connect with others.
